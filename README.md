# 🅿️ City Parking Home Assistant integration
Home Assistant custom integration to provide public street city parking information for any location. This custom component has been built from the ground up to fetch public parking information and integrate this information into Home Assistant. This integration is built against the API and public websites provided by [seety.co](https://seety.co/) and [seety Maps](https://map.seety.co/?lang=en). (and maybe other similar sites such as [Parkopedia](https://en.parkopedia.com/) in future). Sensors will be created for any desired location and specific service can be called to get parking information ad hoc of any location. 

This integration is in no way affiliated with seety.

| :warning: Please don't report issues with this integration to other platforms, they will not be able to support you. |

# Main use case

Whenever you exit your car (and while not at home), check if any public city parking limitations apply for your current location. Warn you when you need to place your parking disk or show local parking rates.

To detect exiting a car, an automation can be defined using sensor.smartphone_ha_activity changing from 'Automotive', or an iOS shortcut can be used to trigger when CarPlay is disconnected and a webhook request can be launched to Home Assistant to trigger an action.






## Installation
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/): search for CityParking in the default HACS repo list or use below button to navigate directly to it on your local system and install via HACS. 
   -    [![Open your Home Assistant instance and open the repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg?style=flat-square)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=myTselectionPublic&repository=CityParking&category=integration)
- Restart Home Assistant
- Add 'City Parking' integration via HA Settings > 'Devices and Services' > 'Integrations'
- In the setup configuration, provide an **origin**. 
   - This can be any HA sensor which has latitutde and longitude attributes (eg `person.jef`, `device_tracker.car`, etc). 

     You can also provide latitude and longitude information, eg `51.3304,3.802`. 

     You can also just provide the full address (but I noticed the current pywaze convertion from address to lat/lon is not very accurate).
- Enter a Geoapify API key during setup. Get an API key at [Geoapify.com](https://myprojects.geoapify.com/register), it has a free tier for 3K geocoding requests per day.  The integration uses Geoapify to reverse geocode coordinates to a street address before asking Seety for parking rules, and falls back to Seety's geocoder if Geoapify cannot return an address.
- By default the integration uses Seety's official external API with the built-in Seety API key. You can still select the legacy Seety web API implementation in the Seety API mode field.
- Existing integration entries can be updated from the integration options, including origin, Seety API mode, Geoapify API key, and a custom Seety API key.


## Integration

### Sensors
- <code>sensor.parking_[origin]_address</code>: sensor with adres linked to location of `origin`
- <code>sensor.parking_[origin]_days_restrictions</code>: sensor with indication of days on which the city parking is restricted
- <code>sensor.parking_[origin]_max_stay</code>: sensor with max amount of minutes is allowed to park during the days and time restricted schedule
- <code>sensor.parking_[origin]_price</code>: sensor with price info for the city parking
- <code>sensor.parking_[origin]_remarks</code>: sensor with remarks related to the the city parking
- <code>sensor.parking_[origin]_restriction_active</code>: sensor with indication if the time and day restrictions are currenlty active. Eg if Sunday the city parking is not restricted, the restricted_active sensor will be False
- <code>sensor.parking_[origin]_time_restrictions</code>: sensor with indication of time schedule duding which the city parking is restricted
- <code>sensor.parking_[origin]_type</code>: sensor with type of city parking zone (eg disk, paid, free, etc)
- <code>sensor.parking_[origin]_zone</code>: sensor with zone name of the city parking (eg green, yellow, orange, red, blue, etc)
- Sensor data will be updated every 5min, unless the coordinates of the origin didn't change. The attribute `time_restriction_active_now`, `day_restriction_active_now`, `maxstay_*` and `restriction_active` will always be updated every 5min. These indicate if the restrictions currently apply.
- <details><summary>For now all sensors have the same set of attributes</summary>

## Status
Proof of concept status, still validating and extending functionalities. [Issues](https://github.com/myTselectionPublic/CityParking/issues) section in GitHub.

## Technical pointers
The main logic and API connection related code can be found within source code CityParking/custom_components/cityparking:
- [sensor.py](https://github.com/myTselectionPublic/CityParking/blob/master/custom_components/cityparking/sensor.py)
- [coordinator.py](https://github.com/myTselectionPublic/CityParking/blob/master/custom_components/cityparking/coordinator.py)
- [seetyApi SeetyAPI](https://github.com/myTselectionPublic/CityParking/blob/master/custom_components/cityparking/seetyApi/__init__.py)

All other files just contain boilerplat code for the integration to work wtihin HA or to have some constants/strings/translations.

If you would encounter some issues with this custom component, you can enable extra debug logging by adding below into your `configuration.yaml`:
```
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
     custom_components.cityparking: debug
```
